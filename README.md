# DeSkewify: Straighten the Story Behind Your Data

[Live App](https://deskewify-app.streamlit.app/)

## 1. Main App: Data Transformation Toolkit

Transform your own data and see the difference:

1. **Upload a CSV** or use the included COVID-19 dataset.
2. **Detect skewness** in numeric columns and get transformation suggestions.
3. **Apply transformations** like Log10, Z-score, Min-Max scaling, or Yeo-Johnson.
4. **Visualize** original vs. transformed data through scatter or line plots.
5. **Compare summary statistics** and make data-driven decisions with confidence.
## 2. Educational Modules

Learn the *what*, *why*, and *how* of data skewness:

- Understand the difference between **normal**, **left-skewed**, and **right-skewed** distributions.
- Explore **real-world examples** and intuitive analogies (like the "wallet money" scenario).
- Visualize how transformations (e.g., **log**, **square root**, **z-score**) reshape skewed data into more balanced forms.
- Gain insight into how skewness affects statistical modeling and data relationships.
